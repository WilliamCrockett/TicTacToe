# Tic Tac Toe
### by William Crockett

___

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS/SASS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* Ajax for API requests
* Jquery for DOM manipulation


## Premise

To create a simple TicTacToe game that communicates with an exisitng Rails API
(API Documentation: https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)

The game logic is custom designed, by me. The API deals with user authentication
and the saving of indiviudal games to a database.

## Known issues

* refreshing the bowser ends current session, and by extension, current game


## Future release roadmap:

* Cleaner UI to indicate who current user is
* Better stats and information around stats
* Multiplayer from seperate devices
* Custom player tokens
* In-game chat with other players
* local storage to persist information in the event of an accidental browser
refresh
